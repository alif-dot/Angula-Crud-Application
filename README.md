Angular CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a technique used in web development to allow users to interact with data stored in a database. Angular, being a powerful front-end framework, provides developers with the tools needed to easily implement CRUD functionality in their web applications. 

In Angular CRUD, users can create new data records, retrieve existing data records, update existing data records, and delete data records as needed. This functionality is typically implemented using Angular's built-in HTTP client module to make requests to a back-end API that communicates with a database. 

Developers can use Angular's powerful data binding and form handling features to easily create interactive forms for creating and editing data records, as well as display data records in tables or other UI components. In addition, Angular provides features such as routing and guards to ensure that users are authorized to perform CRUD operations on data records.

Overall, Angular CRUD is an essential technique in web development, allowing developers to create robust and interactive web applications that can easily interact with data stored in databases.
